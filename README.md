## 🎯 Project Scope & Goals

This project represents my first complete attempt at building an ecommerce-style application end to end.

### Primary Goals
- Prove that I could build a functional ecommerce flow, not just static pages
- Integrate and consume real third-party product data (Nike product API)
- Practice component-based architecture and data flow
- Build with basic SEO considerations in mind (semantic HTML, routing structure, metadata awareness)
- Deploy a live application using a modern platform (Vercel)

The focus was on functionality, learning, and execution, rather than production hardening or full feature parity with real-world ecommerce platforms.

### What This Project Is
- A learning-focused ecommerce build
- An exploration of API integration and real product data
- A demonstration of frontend fundamentals:
  - Routing
  - Component reuse
  - Data-driven UI
  - SEO-aware page structure
